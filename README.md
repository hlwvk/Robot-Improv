# Robot-Improv Project

This project contains data from the "Robot Improv" project, which was carried out in 2022 at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In a study, participants were interacting with a Pepper robot (Softbank Robotics). The python (2.7!) code executes a GUI (Tkinter), which allows for controlling the robot. The Choregraphe project file contains the programmed movements for the robot. For more details and results, see the paper and the supplementary material.
